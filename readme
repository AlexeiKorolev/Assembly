Student 1: What unauthorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information
that you used to complete the assignment, and describe how you used
them. The course "Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of
information, and any source that you have used but not listed in the
authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.

None

Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

I found this assignment very educational. It was very insightful to 
practice my debugging skills, and I did find it fun to be able to
accurately compute large additions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 2: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

This assignment was both informative and fun. I learned a lot about
assembly language and how it relates to C in terms of performance. It
was fun to be able to "beat" the compiler in performance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

We did not find any bugs in our submission.

What is your mywc program test plan?

To cover all boundary cases, we listed all 27 possibilities for line
count, word count, and character count (where for each, there is a
possibility of having none, one, or more than one). Not all these
combinations are legal (such as having 1 line with no characters or
having no words and multiple characters). After eliminating all the
impossible combinations, we were left with possible combinations, and
we generated a string to test each one of these possible combinations,
representing 11 files each with 1 string testing a possible boundary
case.

Boundary tests:

mywc0.txt: "" ->			   0 lines, 0 words, 0 chars
mywc1.txt: "a" -> 		   	   0 lines, 1 words, 1 chars
mywc2.txt: "aa" -> 		   	   0 lines, 1 words, >1 chars
mywc3.txt: "a a a" -> 		    	   0 lines, >1 words, >1 chars
mywc4.txt: "\n" -> 		    	   1 lines, 0 words, 1 chars
mywc5.txt: " \n" -> 		   	   1 lines, 0 words, >1 chars
mywc6.txt: "word \n" -> 	   	   1 lines, 1 words, >1 chars
mywc7.txt: "word1 word2 word3" -> 	   1 lines, >1 words, >1 chars
mywc8.txt: "\n\n\n" ->         		  >1 lines, 0 words, >1 chars
mywc9.txt: "word1 \n\n\n\n" ->		  >1 lines, 1 words, >1 chars
mywc10.txt: "word1 \nword2\nword3\n\n" -> >1 lines, >1 words, >1 chars

Statement tests:
mywc11.txt: " word word2\n" -> This file contains the characteristics
of starting with a space, having multiple words, and ending with a
newline character, and so causes the computer to execute the blocks of
code at lines 31, 35, 37, 43, 45, and 49 of the given mywc.c.
mywc12.txt: "aa\t\nfinishword" -> This file contains the characteristics
of starting within a word, having multiple words, and ending in a word,
and so causes the computer to execute the blocks of code at line 53.

Stress tests:
mywc13.txt: The characteristics of this file is that it is a large
file (the number of characters for the file was MAX_STRING_LENGTH,
determined to be 50,000). Additionally, the stress test file was only
allowed to have a maximum number of newline characters of
MAX_LINE_COUNT (determined to be 700 so that the total number of lines
is less than 1,000). For each character generated there was a 1/3
probability that the character was a newline character
(if there are no more newline characters allowed,then no character is
selected on that iteration), 1/3 probability that the character was a
space character, and 1/3 probability that the character was
alphanumeric/symbols/tabs (ASCII hex characters 0x09 or 0x21 to 0x7E
(inclusive)). This stress tests mywc.c by testing "weird" combinations
of newline, whitespace, and ASCII characters. It also involves a
large file, which causes many iterations of any loops within mywc.c
or mywc.s to execute.
